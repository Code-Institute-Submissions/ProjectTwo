    <p>In the United States, a governor serves as the chief executive officer and commander-in-chief in each of the
        fifty states and in the five permanently inhabited territories, functioning as both head of state and head of
        government therein.[nb 1] As such, governors are responsible for implementing state laws and overseeing the
        operation of the state executive branch. As state leaders, governors advance and pursue new and revised policies
        and programs using a variety of tools, among them executive orders, executive budgets, and legislative proposals
        and vetoes. Governors carry out their management and leadership responsibilities and objectives with the support
        and assistance of department and agency heads, many of whom they are empowered to appoint. A majority of
        governors have the authority to appoint state court judges as well, in most cases from a list of names submitted
        by a nominations committee</p>
